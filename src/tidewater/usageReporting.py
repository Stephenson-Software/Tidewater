"""Usage reporting: tell the trace service that Tidewater was started.

Tidewater reports two events to https://trace.danielstephenson.dev through the
vendored trace client (tidewater/trace_client.py): ``startup`` once per launch and
``save-loaded`` each time a save slot is created or opened. Each carries the
program name and the version from version.txt, and nothing else - no username,
hostname, address, path, slot number or anything about the run.

Reporting is on by default and switched off with
``TIDEWATER_USAGE_REPORTING_ENABLED=false`` in the environment (see
config.Config), or with the two variables every trace client honours,
``TRACE_USAGE_REPORTING=off`` and ``DO_NOT_TRACK=1``. Those two are checked by
the client itself, in its constructor, before Tidewater's own setting - so they
win even when the setting says on. The first time an install reports, one
line saying so is printed on the console and a marker file is left in the
save directory so it is not printed again. What is sent and how to turn it
off is written up at https://github.com/Stephenson-Software/trace#usage-reporting.

The client never gets in the game's way: every report returns immediately (the
HTTP call happens on a daemon thread the client owns), never raises, and at
most 256 reports are queued before new ones are dropped. A disabled client
does nothing and starts no thread.

Under Pyodide (the in-browser front-end) there are no OS threads or sockets, so
the browser build never builds an enabled client; only the console, pygame and
server-backed web front-ends report.
